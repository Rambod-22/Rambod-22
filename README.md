## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Rambod. I am a dedicated and passionate individual currently pursuing a major in Statistics/Combinatorics & Optimization at the University of Waterloo, accompanied by a minor in Computer Science. As a software engineer, I have embarked on a journey to explore the intricate intersections of data, optimization, and technology. Beyond the realm of coding and algorithms, I find joy in the world of physical fitness, actively engaging in weightlifting and various sports. My enthusiasm for software development stems from the satisfaction of creating solutions that have a meaningful impact on the lives of others. Since the beginning of my coding journey, I have been driven by the belief that technology can be a powerful tool for positive change, motivating me to continuously refine my skills and contribute to the ever-evolving landscape of software engineering.
